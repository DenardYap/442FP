**442 Final Project**

This repo contains the code used for our final project. We utilized code from https://github.com/mpc001/Lipreading_using_Temporal_Convolutional_Networks/tree/master.

Code written in cnn.py, additional_models.py, train.py, train_helpers.py, dataloader.py and main.ipynb was written entirely by us.
