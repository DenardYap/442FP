**442 Final Proeject**

This repo contains the code used for our final project. We utilized code from https://github.com/mpc001/Lipreading_using_Temporal_Convolutional_Networks/tree/master.

Code written in TRANSFORMER442FP.py, CNN442FP.py, dataloader.py, greg_script.py, and main.ipynb was written entirely by us.
